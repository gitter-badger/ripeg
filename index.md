## Welcome to ripeg homepage !

Not much content for now, as this project is _very_ early in its infancy. All the meat is [here](https://zyedidia.github.io/preprints/gpeg_sle21.pdf) and we want to port [that Go implementation](https://github.com/zyedidia/gpeg) to Rust.

CI and such are currently being configured before work on code begins.

See the repository [README](https://github.com/lwandrebeck/ripeg/blob/main/README.md) which will probably be the most up-to-date source of informations until everything is up and running and coding phase has begun.

Thanks for your interest in incremental PEG parsing, your contributions are **very** welcome !

Content below is just kept as a reminder.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/lwandrebeck/ripeg/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lwandrebeck/ripeg/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
